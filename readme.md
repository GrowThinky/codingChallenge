ðŸ›¸ Roman Numerals Translator for Intergalactic Travellers
=========================================================
This is a pretty simple solution to the "Merchant's guide to the galaxy"
coding challenge.

## The folder contains an Eclipse Project:

**Code is in:**
heindl.codingChallenge/src/heindl/codingChallenge/Translator.java

**Tests:**
heindl.codingChallenge/src/heindl/codingChallenge/test/TranslatorTest.java


## Notes:
* Inputs need to stick to the format defined in the specification. To handle a
wider range of possible inputs, a possible next step would be using regular expressions
to process the inputs.
* Currently is assuming inputs are actually following the rules of roman
numerals.
* Next step would be improving the string manipulation for input handling.
* Also it would be nice to add support for multiple different currencies apart from
"Credits" which could be inferred automatically from the input.
